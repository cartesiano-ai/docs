## What Is a Competitor?

A **Competitor** is any brand or company you choose to track alongside your own. These are businesses operating in the same market, category, or problem space. Brands your audience might consider as alternatives. By explicitly tracking competitors, you create a benchmark for your own performance in AI-driven search and LLM responses.

## How to track a Competitor

You can view all of your competitors in the **Competitor** screen. To add a new one, click on the "Add new competitor" button.

Additionally, [Cartesiano.ai](http://Cartesiano.ai) will automatically detect competitors everytime your prompts are executed, and let you know when new ones are identified. You can review these suggestions in the "Suggested Competitors" tab.

## Understanding your Competitor Analytics

You can access additional information on a competitor, by clicking the "View Analytics" button. A new panel will open up, showing how your brand compares to this competitor, across the different key metrics:

- Position
- Visibility
- Sentiment
