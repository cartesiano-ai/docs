# What is a Prompt?
A **Prompt** is the input you give to a Large Language Model (LLM) such as ChatGPT to generate a response. It can be a question, command, instruction, or piece of text that guides the model on what to produce.

Prompts shape what an LLM talks about. If a brand isn’t included or relevant to the prompt, the model may not mention it—reducing visibility. When prompts describe a category, problem, or buying scenario, they reveal whether the brand is known, recommended, or ignored by the AI.

Cartesiano.ai allows you to track your Prompts across these 3 important dimensions:

- **Visibility**: if an LLM mentions your brand in category-level prompts (e.g., “Best CRM tools”), it signals stronger brand awareness.
- **Position** in responses counts: Being listed first or early increases perceived authority.
- **Sentiment** is influenced: The model’s tone and wording can shape how users perceive your brand.

By looking at trends and how these 3 metrics evolve over time, we're able to track consistency across prompts. Consistency shows strength - frequent mentions across different use cases indicate higher awareness and market presence.


# Adding a Prompt
1. Go to **Prompts**
2. Click **Add a Prompt**.
3. Enter Your Prompt Text (e.g., “Best email marketing platforms for SMBs”)
4. Select the LLM Model (e.g., ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini)
5. Pick the country or region the prompt should simulate.
6. Click **Add Prompt**

Once saved, the system automatically runs the prompt and you’ll be able to see the AI’s full response, including brand mentions, position, sentiment, competitors, and sources cited.

Unlike other tools where you need to wait 24 hours to see your results, in Cartesiano.ai, you get immediate, measurable insights into how your brand appears in real AI-driven search scenarios.

## Analysing and Understanding your Prompt Results
Once your prompt has been created and executed, the Prompt screen gives you a clear overview of how your brand performs across different LLMs. Here’s what each section means and how to use it.

This table shows how your prompt performed on each LLM (e.g., OpenAI, Anthropic).

You’ll see the 3 key metrics:

**1. Visibility**
Represented by five dots, where Green = your brand was mentioned in that run, Red = your brand was not mentioned. These dots reflect the last 5 runs, helping you spot consistency or drop-offs in awareness over time. Frequent mentions signal stronger presence in AI-driven search results.

**2. Position**
Shows where your brand appeared in the response ranking (e.g., 2nd, 5th, etc.). Lower numbers = higher placement. Higher placement increases trust and likelihood of user attention.

**3. Sentiment**
Labels the tone of the mention: positive, neutral, or negative. Awareness is not enough—perception impacts brand preference.

###Position Distribution
This bar shows how often your brand appears in each tier across all runs:

- Top 80% (Green): Strong visibility and ranking.
- Middle 20% (Yellow): Moderate performance.
- Bottom 0% (Red): Rarely or never mentioned.

###Sources Cited
This table lists the websites or publications most frequently referenced by the LLMs when generating answers.

You’ll see:
- Source name
- URL
- Number of mentions

It's crucial to keep track of sources mentioned as it reveals which online publications shape the AI’s knowledge about your brand, highlighting potential SEO, PR, or content partnership opportunities. It helps you understand why certain brands are being mentioned more often than yours.
