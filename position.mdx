### What is it?
**Position** measures *where* your brand appears **within** an AI Search Engine responses. It answers: *“When I am mentioned, how prominently?”*

In LLM answers, order matters. First position usually means strongest authority. In the SEO world, this is similar to ranking higher in a Google search. The higher you rank, the more likely you'll be notices.


### How is it calculated?
`Average Position = Sum of all ranking positions / Total number of mentions`

A lower score is better, where a position of `1` would indicate that you're at the top of the AI Search engine response for that prompt.

### Why Track It?
Because visibility alone is not enough. If your brand always appears **third or fourth**, you’re being presented as a secondary option, not as the industry leader.

High position signals:

- Higher trust assigned by the AI  
- Stronger authority signals in your documentation or content  
- Better alignment between your messaging and user intent  

Low position usually highlights:

- Poor technical documentation  
- Competitors with stronger content signals  
- Missing entity definitions, schemas, or public data  
- Outdated messaging the AI considers less relevant

### Real Use Cases
**1. “Always mentioned but never first”**  
A productivity tool is mentioned in 80% of responses, but always after two larger competitors. Position data uncovers the brand’s “second-tier” status in LLM reasoning.

**2. Tracking category leadership**  
AI consultants and growth teams measure whether their product moves from average position #3 to #1 after updating docs, PR, or developer content.

**3. Drift detection**  
If an LLM starts ranking a lesser-known competitor above you, that’s a red-flag early signal.
