## 1. Adding Your Company

The first step is to provide some basic information about your company. This will allow our tool to start gathering data and suggesting relevant prompts and competitors.

1. **Navigate to the 'Companies' tab** in the main menu.
2. Under the 'Add a company' section, **enter your company name and website URL**.
3. **Click 'Save'**.

Our system will now automatically analyze your website to understand your industry, products, and services. This analysis is used to generate a list of suggested prompts and identify potential competitors that you should be tracking.

## 2. Creating Your First Prompt

Prompts are the questions and queries that users enter into LLMs. Tracking the right prompts is crucial for understanding your brand's visibility.

### Using Suggested Prompts

Based on your company information, our powerful AI engine is able to leverage its existing knowledge about your brand, it's target users, and we even scrape your website content in real-time to be able to provide a list of suggested prompts. You can find these in the 'Prompts' section of your dashboard. To start tracking a suggested prompt, simply click the **'Track'** button next to it.

### Adding a Custom Prompt

You have the flexibility to add any prompt you want to track.

1. **Go to the 'Prompts' section.**
2. **Click on 'Add New Prompt'.**
3. **Enter the prompt** you want to track (e.g., "What is the best CRM for small businesses?").
4. **Select the LLMs** you want to track this prompt in (e.g., ChatGPT, Gemini, Claude).
6. **Click 'Add Prompt'**.

Everytime you add a prompt, we will automatically process it immediately, so that you have access to its performance right away. After that, we periodically run all of your prompts across all target AI searh engines every 24 hours.

## 3. Tracking a Competitor

Understanding how your competitors are performing in AI search is key to identifying opportunities and refining your strategy.

1. **Navigate to the 'Competitors' tab.**
2. You will see a list of **suggested competitors** based on our analysis of your website. To start tracking a suggested competitor, click the **'Track'** button.
3. To add a competitor manually, click **'Add Competitor'**.
4. **Enter the competitor's name and website URL.**
5. **Click 'Add'**.

Once you've added competitors, their performance will be benchmarked against yours across all your tracked prompts.

## 4. Understanding Your Dashboard

The main dashboard is where you'll find all the analytics for your tracked prompts. Here's a breakdown of the key metrics:

### Share of Voice

Share of Voice (SoV) measures your brand's visibility compared to your competitors for the prompts you are tracking. [1, 4] A higher SoV means your brand is mentioned more frequently and prominently in AI-generated responses.

### Average Rank

This metric shows your brand's average ranking within the AI-generated responses. A lower number indicates a better ranking (e.g., a rank of 1 means you were the first brand mentioned).

### Sentiment Analysis

We analyze the sentiment of the text surrounding your brand's mentions, categorizing it as **positive, neutral, or negative**. [9] This helps you understand the context in which your brand is being discussed.

### Competitor Placement

The 'Competitors' tab on your dashboard provides a side-by-side comparison of your performance against your competitors for each tracked prompt. You can see who is gaining or losing visibility over time.
