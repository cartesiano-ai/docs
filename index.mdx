## 1. Adding Your Company

The first step is to provide some basic information about your company. This will allow our tool to start gathering data and suggesting relevant prompts and competitors.

1. **Navigate to the 'Companies' tab** in the main menu.
2. Under the 'Add a company' section, **enter your company name and website URL**.
3. **Click 'Save'**.

A Company is a parent component of your [Cartesiano.ai](http://Cartesiano.ai) dashboard, and you can have many companies, depending on your plan. Whenever you create a Prompt or a Competitor, they are always linked to a company.

If you have multiple companies configured, you can toggle between them from the dropdown menu in the Dashboard.

## 2. Creating Your First Prompt

Prompts are the questions and queries that users enter into LLMs like ChatGPT. Tracking the right prompts is crucial for understanding your brand's visibility.

### Using Suggested Prompts

Based on your company information, our powerful AI engine is able to leverage its existing knowledge about your brand, it's target users, and we even scrape your website content in real-time to be able to provide a list of suggested prompts your real users may be using to either find out about your company/brand or its competitors.

You can find these in the 'Prompts' section of your dashboard. To start tracking a suggested prompt, simply click the **'Track'** button next to it.

### Adding a Custom Prompt

You have the flexibility to add any prompt you want to track.

1. **Go to the 'Prompts' section.**
2. **Click on 'Add New Prompt'.**
3. **Enter the prompt** you want to track (e.g., "What is the best CRM for small businesses?").
4. **Select the LLMs** you want to track this prompt in (e.g., ChatGPT, Gemini, Claude).
6. **Click 'Add Prompt'**.

Everytime you add a prompt, we will automatically process it immediately, so that you have access to its performance and analytics right away, and modify it if needed. After that, we periodically run all of your prompts across all target AI searh engines every 24 hours.

Remember that once a Prompt is created, you cannot edit it, so you must delete and create a new one. This is because editing a Prompt may have radical differences in the answers produced by AI search engines, so if we modify it, the historical data is no longer meaningful.

## 3. Tracking a Competitor

Understanding how your competitors are performing in AI search is key to identifying opportunities and refining your strategy. To add a new competitor:

1. **Navigate to the 'Competitors' tab.**
2. You will see a list of **suggested competitors** based on our analysis of your website. To start tracking a suggested competitor, click the **'Track'** button.
3. To add a competitor manually, click **'Add Competitor'**.
4. **Enter the competitor's name and website URL.**
5. **Click 'Add'**.

Once you've added competitors, their performance will be benchmarked against yours across all your tracked prompts.

Don't worry if you forget to add all of your competitors. We are able to automatically detect competitors from how AI search engines answer your prompts, and will surface them to you so you can decide if you want to track or ignore them.

## 4. Understanding Your Dashboard

The main Dashboard is where you'll find all the analytics for your tracked prompts. Here's a breakdown of the key metrics:

### Share of Voice

Share of Voice (SoV) measures your company's visibility compared to your competitors for the prompts you are tracking. A higher SoV means your brand is mentioned more frequently and prominently in AI-generated responses.

### Average Rank

This metric shows your company's average ranking within the AI-generated responses. A lower number indicates a better ranking (e.g., a rank of 1 means you were the first brand mentioned).

### Sentiment Analysis

We analyze the sentiment of the text surrounding your brand's mentions, categorizing it as **positive, neutral, or negative**. This helps you understand the context in which your brand is being discussed.

### Competitor Placement

The 'Competitors' tab on your dashboard provides a side-by-side comparison of your performance against your competitors for each tracked prompt. You can see who is gaining or losing visibility over time.
