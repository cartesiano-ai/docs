# What is a source?

A **Source** is any online resource, such as an article, report, blog, research page, or database, that an LLM references when generating its response. These sources represent the information the model draws from or cites to justify its answer. In short: a Source is the evidence behind the AI’s output.

When your prompt runs, Cartesiano.ai detects and records which sources the LLM referenced so you can see what content is influencing brand mentions and recommendations. This is useful since:

# Why should you track Sources?

**1. Brand Visibility**

If certain publications or reports consistently appear in responses, they’re likely shaping which brands get mentioned and in what context, and as a result, have a higher influence in decisions your consumers are making about your brand.

**2. Competitors**

If competitors are being highlighted because they’re featured in authoritative sources, you can identify where they’re gaining exposure.

**3. Content Strategy Gaps**

If your brand isn’t present in the sources the AI relies on, that’s a clear signal:

- You’re missing coverage.
- Your content isn’t ranking.
- Your brand isn’t being cited in key industry conversations.

**4. Trust and Authority**

LLMs tend to favor credible, high-authority sources. Seeing which ones are referenced helps you understand what the model considers trustworthy, and work towards getting your brand mentioned in those.

# Understanding the Souce Citations

You can view your Source Citations from 2 diffferent places:

1. From the **Prompts** Screen
2. By viewing the**Detailed Prompt**  screen

In these 2 cases, the information provided will be the same. What differs is that in the Prompts Screen, you'll be presented with a summary of all Sources mentioned across all of your Prompts and LLMs, and when you click on a specific Prompt, you will see the source citations used in that particular execution.
