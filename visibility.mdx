## 1. Visibility

### What is it?
**Visibility** measures how often your company or brand appears in AI-generated answers across different LLMs like ChatGPT and Google Gemini.
It answers the question: *“How present is my brand inside AI search?”*

At its core, it’s the **share of answers** containing your brand relative to all answers where your category is discussed.

### How is it calculated?
`Visibility = (Number of answers mentioning your company) / (Total answers for your prompt)`

### Why Track It?
Because if you don’t appear in an LLM’s answers, you don’t exist to the user (it's the SEO equivalent of not being ranked in Google). High visibility correlates directly with:

- Higher AI-search traffic  
- Better brand recall  
- Stronger category authority  
- Increased likelihood of recommendation by the LLM

Low visibility means competitors are controlling the narrative inside AI.

### Real Use Cases
**1. Inconsistent presence across LLMs**  
A fintech brand sees strong presence in Perplexity but almost no mentions in ChatGPT. Visibility data highlights this gap so the team can work on improving documentation, SEO, and structured content that LLMs can ingest.

**2. Product launch tracking**  
After launching a new feature, the marketing team tracks whether LLMs start mentioning it organically and in which types of prompts.

**3. Competitive intelligence**  
A competitor you track gets a spike in visibility, indicating new PR, marketing, or documentation updates that affected AI recall.
