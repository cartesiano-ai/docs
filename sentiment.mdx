### What is it?
**Sentiment** measures the emotional tone associated with your brand when LLMs mention it. It can be either positive, neutral, or negative. It answers: *“When AI brings up my brand, how does it talk about me?”*


### How is it calculated?
Sentiment is calculated by using machine-learning techniques to understand the context around how your brand is being mentioned. Additionally, we can calculate the overall sentiment percentage:

`Positive Sentiment % = Positive Mentions / Total Mentions`

### Why Track It?
Because LLMs don’t just *list* brands, they *explain* them. The tone used to describe your brand affects trust and overall conversion.

**Negative or neutral** sentiment may indicate:

- Old controversy still influencing model memory  
- Poor online reviews feeding into training data  
- Outdated product messaging  
- Weak positioning compared to competitors  
- Missing positive proof (case studies, technical docs, testimonials)

**Positive** sentiment is a strong predictor of:

- Higher recommendation rates  
- Stronger AI-driven conversions  
- Brand preference in ambiguous or “best tool for X” queries
- 
### Real Use Cases

**1. Detecting outdated information**  
A cybersecurity startup discovers ChatGPT repeatedly describes their 2022 outage as current. Sentiment alerts help them identify training-data residue they can counteract with updated content.

**2. Competitor comparison**  
Sentiment shows that while a competitor appears slightly more often, the model speaks about them with neutral/negative tone due to pricing complaints. This is an advantage to exploit.

**3. Brand health monitoring**  
Teams track whether major announcements (funding, new feature, partnership) generate a measurable shift toward positive sentiment in LLM answers.
